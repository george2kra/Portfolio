  <h2 id="aboutme">About me</h2>
  <h3>A Melbournian since the age of 1  </h3>
  <p>My parents migrated from Macedonia to Australia in 1966.
    Taking on the Melbournian culture I grew up watching football,
    cricket and tennis eating meat pies and fish and chips.<br><br>

    After a long career in IT administration, I have taken time off to complete
    a software development course that includes Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS,
    Javascripts, and React at the Coder Factory Acedemy in order to
    become an accomplished full stack developer.<br><br>

    I have a background in database management as well as Backup and
    Storage administration which has provided me a strong base in
    becoming a great coder. I developed a knack for coding when I had a
    need to code scripts in Rexx, Korn, and Bash to automate manual processes
    while in I.T. administrations.<br><br>

    In my late teens I started as a Tape and Print jockey within a
    computer department ensuring mount requests for data on tape were
    processed efficiently and prints dispatched on time. Soon afterwards
    I was promoted as an Operations Analyst where I provisioned resources
    to ensure a successful overnight batch schedule. My interests lead me
    to database administration, where I was more involed in projects,
    organizing table structures, and tuning SQL code.<br><br>

    Opportunities took me Backup and Storage management, dealing with
    data backup and recovery strategies, provisoning storage,
    volume replication, disk encryption, and disaster recovery planning.
    <br><br>
    Outside of IT I love the AFL sport where I get to go to  games with
    friends and enjoy the pace of the match especially when Geelong wins.
    I am also an avid foodie fan, I particularly enjoy Thai cuisines and
    street festivals, but most of love the chase of finding the next great eat.
